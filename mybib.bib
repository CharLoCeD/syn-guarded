   abstract = {Let $$\kappa $$be a regular cardinal. We study Gabriel–Ulmer duality when one restricts the 2-category of locally $$\kappa $$-presentable categories with $$\kappa $$-accessible right adjoints to its locally full sub-2-category of $$\kappa $$-presentable Grothendieck topoi with geometric $$\kappa $$-accessible morphisms. In particular, we provide a full understanding of the locally full sub-2-category of the 2-category of $$\kappa $$-small cocomplete categories with $$\kappa $$-small colimit preserving functors arising as the corresponding 2-category of presentations via the restriction. We analyse the relation of these presentations of Grothendieck topoi with site presentations and we show that the 2-category of locally $$\kappa $$-presentable Grothendieck topoi with geometric $$\kappa $$-accessible morphisms is a reflective sub-bicategory of the 2-category of weakly $$\kappa $$-ary sites [in the sense of Shulman (Theory Appl Categ 27:97–173, 2012)] with morphisms of sites.},

abstract = {Sequential colimits are an important class of higher inductive types. We present a self-contained and fully formalized proof of the conjecture that in homotopy type theory sequential colimits appropriately commute with Σ-types. This result allows us to give short proofs of a number of useful corollaries, some of which were conjectured in other works: the commutativity of sequential colimits with identity types, with homotopy fibers, loop spaces, and truncations, and the preservation of the properties of truncatedness and connectedness under sequential colimits. Our entire development carries over to (∞, 1)-toposes using Shulman's recent interpretation of homotopy type theory into these structures.},
